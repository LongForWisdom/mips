## Specification
    
### Motivation

This amendment modifies only MIP4. 

The primary reason for making this amendment is to explictly allow MIP4c2 subproposals to modify multiple MIPs in the same amendment. This is beneficial because often a phrase or concept created in one MIP is repeated or referenced in another MIP. While it is possible to create multiple MIP4c2 proposals to make a change in this situation, it doesn't really make sense to do so because if one sub-proposal passed and the other did not it would leave MIPs inconsistent. I made a similar logical change to MIP4c3, allowing multiple MIPs to be removed in a single sub-proposal.

In addition to making this change. I have 'tightened up' the language in MIP4 and generally modified it to be more self-consistent, and each section more appropriate to the heading under which it lives. No significant change in logic has ocurred outside those noted above.

I feel these changes are valid for an amendment rather than a replacement because the purpose of MIP4 has not changed, and the logic has only expanded slightly. 

No other MIPs interact directly with MIP4, so there are no dependency issues surrounding these changes.
