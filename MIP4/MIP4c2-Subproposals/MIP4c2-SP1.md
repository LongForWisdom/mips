## Specification

### Motivation

Today, MIP6 currently requires MIP6 collateral applications to go through Domain Greenlight ([MIP8](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP8/mip8.md)) to be eligible for the Community Greenlight Poll ([MIP9](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP9/mip9.md)). Based on community feedback as well as general thoughts from the Authors and Contributors, the collateral onboarding process would be more efficient and effective if it did not require Domain Greenlight (MIP8) to occur before the Community Greenlight Poll ([MIP9](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP9/mip9.md)). This amendment MIP requests to allow collateral applications to be eligible for [MIP9](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP9/mip9.md) Community Greenlight polls at least two weeks after the [MIP6](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP6/mip6.md) application has been proposed, moving the Domain Greenlight process until after the polls have concluded. This amendment to the collateral onboarding process also helps with Domain team bandwidth and allows the Domain teams to allocate their time to collateral assets only after the community has approved them.

This amendment to [MIP6](https://github.com/makerdao/mips/blob/master/MIP6/mip6.md) affects the general collateral onboarding flow previously proposed in the ratified Collateral Onboarding MIPs Set. Ultimately, it allows the collateral onboarding process to become more efficient.
